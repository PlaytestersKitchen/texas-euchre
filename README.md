# Texas Euchre

A free for all game with two phases, a draw phase, and a trick taking phase.

The goal is to have the highest hand as early as possible, and take tricks with that hand.

Accumulate points over the course of several rounds and you'll end the game, and lose. Avoid points to win.

Recommended number of players: 3 - 5

## What You'll Need

 - A standard deck of playing cards, Jokers removed.
 - A way to keep score (counters, pen and paper, a smartphone, etc.)

## Setting Up

Deal five cards to each player. Players take turns being the dealer.

Place the remaining cards in the center. This is the draw deck.

## Drawing Up

Starting on the player to the dealer's left, lay down up to five cards face up in front of you.
Replace that number of cards from the draw pile into your hand. Your turn is now over.
This continues until a player lays down their hand, signaling the end of the draw phase, moving into the trick taking phase.

The objective of the game is to have the highest cards (on average), as quickly as possible, so discard your lowest cards.

## Laying Down

At the beginning of your turn, if you feel you have the highest hand at the table, lay your cards face down in front of you.
This is called throwing down, and signals the last turn until the end of the draw phase.

*This excludes your first turn.* [*See the FAQ.*](#can-i-lay-down-on-the-very-first-round)

## Last Draw

This is the last turn until the beginning of the trick taking phase.

Players do not have to draw cards on the last draw phase turn.

## Facing Off

When the player who originally laid down is reached, they are the first to lead in the trick taking phase.
They lay down a card from their hand, giving each player, starting on the left of the lead, a chance to beat it.
Higher cards win. Ties are resolved to whomever threw the tying card first.

Whoever has the highest card takes the trick, and leads with the next card.
That player should take the cards played that turn, and keep them in a pile next to them to signify one trick taken.
Play continues until all five tricks are won.

Whoever had the least amount of tricks takes as many points as they had laid down during the draw phase.
Ties for last place all take points.

If the player who originally laid down takes the least number of tricks, they take double the points in front of them.
Players who tie for the most tricks are all considered as taking the most tricks that round.

If the player who threw down takes all five tricks, all other players take double the points in front of them.

## Next Round

The player to the left of the previous dealer is now the dealer.

## Game End

The game ends when any player hits a specified number of points, for instance, 100.

When this happens, the player with the least number of points wins.

# FAQ

#### Can I lay down on the very first round?

No, you have to draw at least one card the first round. You can lay down the second round, though.

#### Can I play my cards in any order during the trick taking phase?

Yes. You should save your best cards for when you're last to take action. This will reduce your chances of taking zero tricks that round.

#### What if I don't lay down, but I take all five tricks?

You don't force the table to take double points.

#### What if I throw down, but come in second?

You take the number of points in front of you.

#### What if I don't throw down, but I don't come in last, either?

You take zero points.

#### What happens if a game ends with two players who both have the lowest score?

Whoever took points last loses. If both players both took points in the same round together, the one who took the most points that round loses.
